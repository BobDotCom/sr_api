# SR_Api
An async Python wrapper for some-random-api

Welcome, and thank you for using this api wrapper! This wrapper is completely async! Please note that I am not the creator of some-random-api. I only made this api wrapper! I also want to thank ir-3 for helping me get started with this.

For any questions and support for the wrapper, you can visit the [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/wZSH7pz "Devision")

# Getting Started:
To begin with, you'll have to install the package by doing one of the following commands:
- `pip install -U sr_api`
- `python -m pip -U install sr_api`
 
Or you can install directly from source by doing one of the following commands:
- `pip install -U git+https://github.com/iDutchy/sr_api`
- `python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/iDutchy/sr_api`
 
After that, you will have to create the client:
```python
import sr_api

client = sr_api.Client()
```

For full usage, please read the [documentation](https://github.com/iDutchy/sr_api/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md)
